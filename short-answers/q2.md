# Question
What is event delegation?

# Answer
Event delegation is an event-handling pattern that allows you to handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree other than the level where the event was first recieved.

Your asnwer is correct. I'd add that instead of attaching event listeners to each individual child element, you delegate the responsibility of handling events to a higher-level ancestor.
